            <p>La Segunda Vida is a online marketplace for people to sell their “loved” items to others and give them a chance to live a second life. </p>

            <h2 class="rightheader">Why do we do this?</h2>
            <img src="/img/stp.jpg" height="400px" width="1000px" alt="two girls one wearing a white shirt with red hair holding up a sign that says save the planet and another girl with brown hair and glasses holding up a globe">
            <p>We do this because we want to help make shopping and selling simple and easy for both the consumer and seller while helping save the environment. buying used items is a sustainable option that keeps them out of the landfills, reduces carbon and chemical pollution caused by clothing production, and lowers water consumption while preserving the resources that go into making new goods. </p>

            <h2 class="leftheader">How can it benefit you?</h2>

            <p>Most online marketplaces have absurd monthly fees and take out percentages from each sale plus add on shipping costs which makes it hard for the seller to make any profit and more expensive for the buyers. We want to eliminate all those absurd cost and make it one small flat monthly payment to make everything straight forward for the buyers and sellers. We also want to offer to the sellers a place to be in control of everything! They will have the option to customize their webpage to their liking as if it were their own website or have the option to have someone do it for them for a small additional fee. When it comes to the shipping part the seller will be in complete control and be able to pick their own method on how they wish to ship their items we will assist with creating the labels for them for free. Our goal is to get your “loved” items to others and give them a chance to live a second life as easy as possible! </p>

            <p>La Segunda Vida means The Second Life in English. La Segunda also has a second meaning that means “The Thrift Store” in Spanish. La Segunda holds a dear place in my heart because growing up I would always go to thrifts store with my grandma because that’s all we could afford when we needed “new” things like clothing or furniture. I remember her saying “Vamos a la Segunda” and that was one of my favorite sayings because that meant a shopping trip. I wanted to keep that saying alive and share that memory with others who had similar experience like myself. </p>
